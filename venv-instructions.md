# Activate venv
```
.activate.ps1
```

You may need to change the kernel in VS code to venv, if unable to run code. 

# Deactivate venv
```
deactivate
```

# Add packages
Add any required imports to `requirements.txt`. 

If venv is active: run pip install <the package>.

If vev is deactivated: just activate venv with the updated txt file.
